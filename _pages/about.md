I am a PhD student in Societal Computing at Carnegie Mellon University.

I'm interested in understanding people's behaviors in online social networks using natural language processing techniques. Currently, I am focusing on two research areas. One is understanding users' semantic expressions from texts. The other is latent attributes inference of users in social media.

I am lucky to be advised by [Kathleen M. Carley](http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/bios/carley/carley.html).
