I am a PhD student in Societal Computing at Carnegie Mellon University. My research interest lies at the intersection of deep learning, social computing and nature language processing.

My current research focuses on understanding people's behaviors in online social networks using natural language processing techniques. One is understanding users' emotion expressions from texts. The other is latent attributes inference of users in social media.

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Kathleen M. Carley](http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/bios/carley/carley.html).
